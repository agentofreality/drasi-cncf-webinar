## Repository Purpose

This repository contains materials and resources for a CNCF webinar on Drasi. It is currently in early setup phase with minimal content.

## Current Structure

The repository is newly initialized and contains:
- README.md with basic project description
- This CLAUDE.md file for development guidance

## Expected Content Types

As this webinar repository develops, expect to work with:
- Presentation materials and slides
- Demo applications and code examples
- Kubernetes manifests and Docker configurations
- Setup and installation scripts
- Documentation and tutorial materials

## Development Notes

Since this is a webinar resource repository, when adding content:
- Organize materials by topic or demo section
- Include clear setup instructions for any demos
- Ensure all code examples are self-contained and runnable
- Add appropriate documentation for each component
